## Description:
 * `Command Injection Attacks` are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (e.g. form, http headers, etc.) to system shell.
 * This attack differs from `Code Injection`, in that code injection allows the attacker to add their own code that is then executed by the application.
 * In `Command Injection ` , the attacker extends the default functionality of application, which execute system command, without the necessity of injecting code.
